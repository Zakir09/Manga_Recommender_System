<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
Recommendation systems are increasingly important in todayâ€™s world, where people have limited time and an overwhelming number of choices. Our Manga Recommendation System helps users discover new manga, manhwa, and manhua based on their selections. By choosing a title from a provided list, the system analyzes its description and tags to suggest similar content, making it easier to find stories that match the user's interests.

1. Cosine Similarity is a metric that allows you to measure the similarity of documents.

2. In order to demonstrate the cosine similarity function, we need vectors. Here, vectors are represented as NumPy arrays.

3. Once we have vectors, we can call cosine_similarity() by passing both vectors. It will calculate the cosine similarity between them.

4. The result will be a value between [0,1]. If it is 0, the vectors are completely different. If it is 1, they are completely similar.
